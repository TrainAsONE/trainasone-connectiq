When run on other devices it should still show the next workout, but

To build
- Install Eclipse with Garmin ConnectIQ plugin and configure
- Checkout this repository
- Copy source/Config.mc.template to source/Config.mc
- Obtain ClientId and ClientSecret from garmin@trainasone.com
- Make the world a better place (hoo!)

This is still very much a work in progress. It runs as a widget.

Source formatting preferences
- 2 character spaces
- Use spaces rather than tabs
- Unix line endings

Releasing
- Update version in source/Version.mc
- Copy manifest-downloadcapable.xml to manifest.xml, run App Export Wizard, upload generated .iq as TrainAsONE
- Copy manifest-allwatches.xml to manifest.xml, run App Export Wizard, save generated .iq as TrainAsONE-lite

Note: SDK 2.4.4 has broken calling workout intents, so the app can download, but not run workouts
