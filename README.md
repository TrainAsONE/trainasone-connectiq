TrainAsONE Connect IQ app

This is a simple Connect IQ app to download workouts from the
https://trainasone.com AI running coach.

It is available in the Garmin Store as

Requirements
- Garmin device or simulator

- Indicate next workout details (including distance & duration)
- Download next workout to device

- Checkout this repository

This is still very much a work in progress. It runs as a widget but
currently plays fast and loose with stacking views.
